"Letter: Sarepta Revis to Daniel W. Revis, June 7, 1863","Daniel W. Revis and his wife Sarepta were farmers in Henderson County. They wrote letters to each other during the Civil War while Daniel served in Co. B, 64th Regt., Infantry, North Carolina Troops. Sarepta did not know how to read or write but had family members help her compose letters to send to her husband while he was away. Her letters give a glimpse into her life as she lets him know how their family and farm are faring. In this letter, Sarepta gives Daniel a detailed account of a failed attempt by the Henderson County militia to round up Confederate deserters who were trying to return home. She lists who was killed and injured. There are more deserters than militia in Henderson County.  She wishes she could see Daniel again, and tells him she has moved in with her father.","Revis, Sarepta.","","1863-06-07","","","","","United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Health aspects; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Correspondence; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Desertions; Henderson County (N.C.); Women--North Carolina--Social conditions; Confederate States of America--Social conditions","","","Daniel W.

This folder includes correspondence, minutes, newsletters, programs, and rosters related to the Jeanes Foundation. The Negro Rural School Fund of the Anna T. Jeanes Foundation was an endowment created by Anna T. Jeanes, a Quaker from Philadelphia in 1907. The Jeanes Fund was responsible for training African American teachers, who provided an education for African American children in the rural South. African American women, who were often deeply entwined within their local communities, taught industrial, academic, and domestic skills to their students. The education of these skills imparted the knowledge needed to help improve the lives of African Americans as a whole during legal segregation. Subjects in this folder include conference attendance, conference scheduling, regional supervisors meetings, and Jeanes membership. Some of the conference themes included &quot;Education Makes the Way for Tomorrow&#39;s Citizens,&quot; &quot;Fifty Years of Jeanes Service,&quot; and &quot;Providing for Effective Learning.&quot; The State Supervisor of Elementary Education in the Division of Negro Education travelled the state monitoring the quality of African American elementary schools, conducting meetings with school staff, organizing funding, and teaching demonstration classes.","North Carolina.

She tells him that some of the children are sick. The corn, sweet potato, and Irish potato crops look good and Thomas is helping her plow. She wishes Francis was home so that they would have more to eat and she wouldn&#39;t have to work when she was unable to do so. Their new daughter is four weeks old and still needs a name; she includes cutout of the baby girl&#39;s hand on a separate piece of paper. She tells about some local people including wounded soldiers and a man who deserted and was sent back. His mother has visited her recently. She tells Francis not to vote for Vance but instead to vote for Holden. She worries about Francis, and tells him she cannot keep working as hard as she has to without him at home. She complains about the price of thread and cotton.","Poteet, Martha Hendley","","1864-06-16","","","","","United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Correspondence; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Children; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Health aspects; Corn; Sweet potatoes; Voting; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Women; Women--North Carolina; Family farms; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Food supply; Money--Confederate States of America; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Desertions; Cotton; North Carolina--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Sources","","","Poteet-Dickson Letters, 1861-1902.
