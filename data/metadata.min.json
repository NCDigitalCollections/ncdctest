This folder includes correspondence, minutes, newsletters, programs, and rosters related to the Jeanes Foundation. The Negro Rural School Fund of the Anna T. Jeanes Foundation was an endowment created by Anna T. Jeanes, a Quaker from Philadelphia in 1907. The Jeanes Fund was responsible for training African American teachers, who provided an education for African American children in the rural South. African American women, who were often deeply entwined within their local communities, taught industrial, academic, and domestic skills to their students. The education of these skills imparted the knowledge needed to help improve the lives of African Americans as a whole during legal segregation. Subjects in this folder include conference attendance, conference scheduling, regional supervisors meetings, and Jeanes membership. Some of the conference themes included \"Education Makes the Way for Tomorrow's Citizens,\" \"Fifty Years of Jeanes Service,\" and \"Providing for Effective Learning.\" The State Supervisor of Elementary Education in the Division of Negro Education travelled the state monitoring the quality of African American elementary schools, conducting meetings with school staff, organizing funding, and teaching demonstration classes.","African Americans--Education; African Americans--Education--History; African Americans--Education (Higher); Education--North Carolina; Teachers", "/items/coll065.html" ],
