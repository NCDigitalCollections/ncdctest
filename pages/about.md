### About the {{site.title}}

{{ site.description }}

The year 2020 marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing and protecting women's constitutional right to vote. Despite decades of marches, petitions, and passage of the 19th Amendment, it did not grant voting rights for all. The ongoing fight for equity continues today.

“She Changed the World: NC Women Breaking Barriers,” an initiative by the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, celebrates the achievements of North Carolina women and explores the diversity of their experiences and impact on our history.

We invite you to join us by sharing your story with #SheChangedtheWorld and #NCHerstory.
